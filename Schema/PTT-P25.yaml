  title: PTT-P25
  description: A radio talk path, typically a P25 or analog talkgroup on a conventional or trunked radio system. However, may be operating in direct (talk-around) mode or through a conventional radio repeater. The only required are channelId, WACN, systemId and groupMode. The channelAlias field is required if known. All other fields are optional.
